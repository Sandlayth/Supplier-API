# Supplier-API

I use this project to get used to the "Uncle Bob" called clean architecture Golang API.
It uses [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/mux](gorilla/mux) as a framework for handling the routing and serving the requests.

In order to run it, you can go either for
```
go run ./cmd/main.go
```
or
```
go build ./cmd/main.go
```
